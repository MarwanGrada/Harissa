 <h1 class="boo">The Health Benefits of Hot Sauce</h1>
<div class="mContainer">
  
   <h1>Diabetes Prevention</h1>
    <p>A study published in the July 2006 issue of "The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition" found that when participants consumed a meal with capsaicin and a meal without it, their insulin levels were more normalized after consuming the capsaicin meal than the plain meal. This was especially true for overweight participants. The study indicates that the habitual consumption of meals containing capsaicin may be useful in preventing meal-induced hyperinsulinemia, or increased insulin levels, which can lead to insulin resistance -- and Type 2 diabetes.</p><br>

    <h1>Weight Management</h1>
    <p>Hot sauce can also boost your metabolism for hours after you eat it, which can help with weight management and the prevention of obesity, as noted in a June 2007 "Los Angeles Times" article. Further, an animal study published in the February 2013 issue of the "European Journal of Nutrition" indicates that eating a meal with hot sauce reduces levels of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates hunger. At the same time, it raises levels of GLP-1, which is an appetite-suppressing hormone. As such, by spicing your food with hot sauce, you may take in fewer calories than you otherwise would and better manage your weight</p>
  

  
    <h1>Antioxidants and Nutrition</h1>
    <p>Antioxidants, such as vitamins A and C, are man-made or natural substances that may prevent or delay some types of cell damage. Antioxidants also work to eliminate oxidative stress in the body, which is a major factor in aging. Furthermore, there is good evidence that eating a diet rich in antioxidants is healthy and lowers risks of certain diseases, notes MedlinePlus. Hot sauce is a source of vitamin C, which is necessary for the production of collagen, a protein required to help wounds heal. Hot sauce contains vitamin A, folate, magnesium and potassium, so it imparts more nutritional value to your food.</p><br>

    <h1>Does Cancer Hate Spicy Foods?</h1>
    <p>The average chile pepper is a simple plant, but scientists are just beginning to understand peppers. Researchers are working on linking hot peppers to the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, weight loss and cancer.<br>

    Capsaicin does something incredible. It causes cells -- notably cancer cells -- to undergo apoptosis, which is basically cellular suicide.<br>

    Much more testing is needed. It is unknown, for example, how much digested capsaicin enters the bloodstream and how long it remains. New Mexico State University plants and environmental sciences professor Mary O'Connell is in search of funding for research to find out. She calls the chile pepper's prospects as a cancer fighter "tantalizing".<br>
    The state of New Mexico, O'Connell points out, has a lower rate of cancer incidence compared to the rest of the country. Is it because the local diet is rich in hot peppers and hot sauces? No one knows for sure.<br>
    "It's an aspect about our environment that is unusual,"" O'Connell said.</p>
